=Updating the thread=
_There is no interface for the admin part yet, all admin updates should go directly to the SQLite tables_

To post a topic:
  # INSERT INTO topic VALUES (NULL, 'Topic text here', date('Y-m-d H:i:s'))
  # Do not leave the date field empty, as this will be used to mark the end of the previous topic.

To lock the thread:
  # UPDATE thread SET site-status='locked' WHERE ID=1
  # You can also use maintenance instead of locked.

To change the locked notice message:
  # UPDATE thread SET site-notice='Went Fishing.' WHERE ID=1

=Configuring the thread=

To tune the polling intervals:
  # Open up docroot/ajax/update.php
  # $interval is the time between checking the database for new items, in seconds.
  # $loops is the number of times the script will check the database per request.
